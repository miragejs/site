# Integration and unit tests

While Mirage was originally designed for acceptance testing, it also works great when writing integration and unit tests.

## Reusing your global server

Let's say you have a data-fetching component, and you want to write a test to verify its behavior.

You could use the `startMirage` convention covered in the previous guide and test your component against your global server definition, just like you would in an application test:

```js
// UserTable.test.js
import UserTable from "./UserTable"
import { startMirage } from "./mirage"

let server

beforeEach(() => {
  server = startMirage()
})

afterEach(() => {
  server.shutdown()
})

it("fetches the list of countries", async () => {
  server.createList("user", 5)

  const { getByTestId } = render(<UserTable />)

  await waitForElement(() => getByTestId("users"))

  expect(getByTestId("user-row")).toHaveLength(5)
})
```

## Creating one-off servers

You could also create new one-off Mirage servers for the sole purpose of testing your component. This works well for component libraries or reusable data-fetching components, or even for testing data-fetching hooks:

```js
// useQuery.test.js
import { Server, Model } from "miragejs"
import React from "react"
import { useQuery } from "./useQuery"

function Movies() {
  const { data } = useQuery("get", "/api/movies")

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Movies</h1>
      {data.movies.map((movie) => (
        <p key={movie.id} data-test-id="movie">
          {movie.title}
        </p>
      ))}
    </>
  )
}

let server

beforeEach(() => {
  server = new Server({
    environment: "test",
    models: {
      movie: Model,
    },
    routes() {
      this.namespace = "api"

      this.resource("movie")
    },
  })
})

afterEach(() => {
  server.shutdown()
})

it("can fetch data", async () => {
  server.createList("movie", 5)

  const { getByTestId } = render(<Movies />)

  await findByText("Movies")

  expect(getAllByTestId("movie")).toHaveLength(5)
})
```

Now you know how to test anything that depends on the network, from a single component to your entire application!

Next we'll discuss some common ways to assert against your Mirage mock server.
