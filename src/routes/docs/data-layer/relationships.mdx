# Relationships

Once you've defined your models, you can define relationships between them using the `belongsTo` and `hasMany` helpers. Each helper adds some dynamic methods to your model.

## belongsTo

To define a to-one relationship, import the `belongsTo` helper and define a new property on a model that points to another model:

```js
import { Server, Model, belongsTo } from "miragejs"

new Server({
  models: {
    blogPost: Model.extend({
      author: belongsTo(),
    }),

    author: Model,
  },
})
```

This defines a `belongsTo` relationship to an `Author` model.

The `belongsTo` helper adds several new properties and methods to your models.

In this case, our `BlogPost` model now gains an `authorId` property, as well as some methods for working with the associated `author` model:

```js
blogPost.authorId // 1
blogPost.authorId = 2 // updates the relationship
blogPost.author // Author instance
blogPost.author = anotherAuthor
blogPost.newAuthor(attrs) // new unsaved author
blogPost.createAuthor(attrs) // new saved author (updates blogPost.authorId in memory only)
```

Note that that the `createAuthor` method will create a new author and immediately save it to the `db`, but the blog post's foreign key is updated _on this instance only_, and is not immediately persisted to the database. So `blogPost.authorId` will be updated in memory, but if you were to fetch the `blogPost` from the `db` again, the relationship would not be persisted.

To persist the new foreign key, you would need to call `blogPost.save()` after creating the new author.

## hasMany

To define a to-many relationship, use the `hasMany` helper:

```js
import { Server, Model, hasMany } from "miragejs"

new Server({
  models: {
    blogPost: Model.extend({
      comments: hasMany(),
    }),

    comment: Model,
  },
})
```

This helper adds a `commentIds` property to the `blogPost` model, as well as some methods for working with the associated `comments` collection:

```js
blogPost.commentIds // [1, 2, 3]
blogPost.commentIds = [2, 3] // updates the relationship
blogPost.comments // array of related comments
blogPost.comments = [comment1, comment2] // updates the relationship
blogPost.newComment(attrs) // new unsaved comment
blogPost.createComment(attrs) // new saved comment (comment.blogPostId is set)
```

## One to one

A one-to-one relationship can be defined using the `belongsTo` helper on two models:

```js
import { Server, Model, belongsTo } from "miragejs"

new Server({
  models: {
    supplier: Model.extend({
      account: belongsTo(),
    }),

    account: Model.extend({
      supplier: belongsTo(),
    }),
  },
})
```

By default, Mirage will mark these two relationships as inverses of each other and therefore be able to keep them in sync as they change. For example, if `supplierA.account` was `accountB`, `accountB.supplier` would point back to `supplierA`. And if `supplierA.account` was set to `null`, the `accountB.supplier` side of the relationship would also be set to `null` to keep the relationships in sync.

## One to many

A one-to-many relationship can be defined using the `belongsTo` helper on one model and the `hasMany` helper on an inverse:

```js
import { Server, Model, belongsTo, hasMany } from "miragejs"

new Server({
  models: {
    user: Model.extend({
      comments: hasMany(),
    }),

    comment: Model.extend({
      user: belongsTo(),
    }),
  },
})
```

Mirage will mark these as inverses of each other, and keep them in sync as they change.

## Many to many

A many-to-many relationship can be defined using the `hasMany` helper on two models:

```js
import { Server, Model, hasMany } from "miragejs"

new Server({
  models: {
    blogPost: Model.extend({
      tags: hasMany(),
    }),

    tag: Model.extend({
      blogPosts: hasMany(),
    }),
  },
})
```

Mirage will mark these as inverses of each other, and keep them in sync as they change.

## Association options

The following options are available to customize your `belongsTo` and `hasMany` relationship definitions.

### modelName

If your associations model has a different name than the association itself, you can specify the `modelName` on the association.

For example,

```js
import { Server, Model, belongsTo, hasMany } from "miragejs"

new Server({
  models: {
    user: Model,

    annotation: Model,

    blogPost: Model.extend({
      author: belongsTo("user"),
      comments: hasMany("annotation"),
    }),
  },
})
```

would add all the named `author` and `comment` methods as listed above, but use the `User` and `Annotation` models for the actual relationships.

### inverse

Often, relationships can be inverses of each other.

For example, say we had the following two models:

```js
import { Server, Model, belongsTo, hasMany } from "miragejs"

new Server({
  models: {
    blogPost: Model.extend({
      comments: hasMany(),
    }),

    comment: Model.extend({
      blogPost: belongsTo(),
    }),
  },
})
```

In this case, `blogPost.comments` would point to a collection of Comment models, and each one of those Comment models would have a `comment.blogPost` relationship that pointed back to the original post.

Mirage can often infer that two relationships on two different models are inverses of each other, but sometimes you'll need to be explicit. This typically happens if a model has two relationships that point to the same model type.

For example, suppose we had the following schema:

```js
import { Server, Model, belongsTo, hasMany } from "miragejs"

new Server({
  models: {
    user: Model.extend({
      blogPosts: hasMany(),
    }),

    blogPost: Model.extend({
      author: belongsTo("user"),
      reviewer: belongsTo("user"),
    }),
  },
})
```

In this case, Mirage doesn't know which relationship (`blogPost.author` or `blogPost.reviewer`) should by synchronized with the `user.blogPosts` collection. So, you can specify which one is the inverse by using the `inverse` option:

```js
import { Server, Model, belongsTo, hasMany } from "miragejs"

new Server({
  models: {
    user: Model.extend({
      blogPosts: hasMany(),
    }),

    blogPost: Model.extend({
      author: belongsTo("user", { inverse: "blogPosts" }),
      reviewer: belongsTo("user", { inverse: null }),
    }),
  },
})
```

Now, if a blog post is added to `user.blogPosts`, that post's `author` will be correctly updated.

### polymorphic

You can specify whether an association is a polymorphic association by passing `{ polymorphic: true }` as an option.

For example, say you have `BlogPost` and `Picture` models that can both have a `Comment`. Here's how the model definitions could look:

```js
import { Server, Model, belongsTo, hasMany } from "miragejs"

new Server({
  models: {
    blogPost: Model.extend({
      comments: hasMany(),
    }),

    picture: Model.extend({
      comments: hasMany(),
    }),

    comment: Model.extend({
      commentable: belongsTo({ polymorphic: true }),
    }),
  },
})
```

We give `Comment` models a `commentable` polymorphic relationships, since the model being commented on could either be a `BlogPost` or a `Picture`. Note that `commentable` doesn't have a type, as there's no validation done on which types of models can exist on that relationship.

Polymorphic associations have slightly different method signatures for their foreign keys and build/create methods.

```js
let comment = server.schema.comments.create({ text: "foo" })

comment.buildCommentable("blog-post", { title: "Lorem Ipsum" })
comment.createCommentable("blog-post", { title: "Lorem Ipsum" })

// getter
comment.commentableId // { id: 1, type: 'blog-post' }

// setter
comment.commentableId = { id: 2, type: "picture" }
```

Has-many relationships can also be polymorphic:

```js
import { Server, Model, belongsTo, hasMany } from "miragejs"

new Server({
  models: {
    car: Model,

    watch: Model

    user: Model.extend({
      things: hasMany({ polymorphic: true })
    }),
  },
})
```

```js
let user = server.schema.users.create({ name: "Sam" });

user.buildThing('car', { attrs });
user.createThing('watch', { attrs });

// getter
user.thingIds; // [ { id: 1, type: 'car' }, { id: 3, type: 'watch' }, ... ]

// setter
user.thingIds = [ { id: 2, type: 'watch' }, ... ];
```
