# Part 6 – Relationships

There's another feature in this app – Lists. If you click the button on the left side of the Reminders list, a side panel will open up which shows the different Lists in this app.

But right now, we just see an error in our console because our app is expecting to fetch the lists from `/api/lists`. Let's mock out this endpoint.

To start, we'll define a new `list` model at the top of our server:

```js{2}
models: {
  list: Model,
  reminder: Model,
}
```

We'll also add a new route handler for a GET to `/api/lists` that returns all the lists:

```js
this.get("/api/lists", (schema, request) => {
  return schema.lists.all()
})
```

Mirage now responds with a 200, but no lists. Let's create some in `seeds()`:

```js{6-7}
seeds(server) {
  server.create("reminder", { text: "Walk the dog" });
  server.create("reminder", { text: "Take out the trash" });
  server.create("reminder", { text: "Work out" });

  server.create("list", { name: "Home" });
  server.create("list", { name: "Work" });
}
```

Now when we open the sidebar, we see our two new lists "Home" and "Work" being rendered.

Try clicking on a list. You'll see an error because our app needs another endpoint: `/api/lists/1/reminders`. This is how our app fetches the reminders for a specific list. Let's see how to mock it out.

The easiest way to mock out endpoints that deal with _relational data_ in Mirage is to associations. We'll start by using Mirage's association helpers to model this data.

In this app, there's a one-to-many relationship between lists and reminders (a list can have many reminders), so we'll use `hasMany` and `belongsTo` helpers to define this relationship:

```js{1,6,10}
import { createServer, Model, hasMany, belongsTo } from "miragejs"

createServer({
  models: {
    list: Model.extend({
      reminders: hasMany(),
    }),

    reminder: Model.extend({
      list: belongsTo(),
    }),
  },
})
```

Now that Mirage knows that the `list.reminders` and `reminder.list` properties are relationships, we can use them in our route handlers.

Let's mock out `/api/lists/:id/reminders` using our new relationships.

```js
this.get("/api/lists/:id/reminders", (schema, request) => {
  let list = schema.lists.find(request.params.id)

  return list.reminders
})
```

We first use a dynamic segment of `:id` which corresponds to the list we clicked. We then use `schema.lists.find(id)` to look up the corresponding list in Mirage's data layer. Finally, we return the reminders associated with that list.

If you try selecting each list, you shouldn't see an error anymore. But you also won't see any reminders. That's because the reminders we've created so far are not associated with any list – we just created them on their own.

To create a reminder for a particular list, we can use our new relationships.

```js{7-8}
seeds(server) {
  // Unassociated reminders
  server.create("reminder", { text: "Walk the dog" });
  server.create("reminder", { text: "Take out the trash" });
  server.create("reminder", { text: "Work out" });

  let homeList = server.create("list", { name: "Home" });
  server.create("reminder", { list: homeList, text: "Do taxes" });

  server.create("list", { name: "Work" });
}
```

Now, clicking "Home" should show the "Do taxes" reminder. And note that our `/api/reminders` endpoint is still returning out all the reminders in our system.

Finally, try making a new reminder for a specific list in the UI. Click Work, then add a reminder to "Visit the bank". If you click around the app, you'll see it's properly associated with the Work list. (It shows up on Work and All, but not Home).

This is because our UI already sends a `{ listId }` if we create a reminder while on a list. To see this, let's add a log to our existing POST route handler to inspect the attrs from the request:

```js{3}
this.post("/api/reminders", (schema, request) => {
  let attrs = JSON.parse(request.requestBody)
  console.log(attrs)

  return schema.reminders.create(attrs)
})
```

When creating an unassociated todo, the attrs are `{ text: "New todo" }`, but an associated todo has attrs like `{ text: "Visit the bank", listId: "2" }`.

When we defined our relationship, Mirage set up special attributes on our models known as foreign keys. These are how it keeps track of which models are associated with each other. Setting a foreing key like `listId` or `reminderIds: []` is enough to update a relationship and have it reflected across all your Mirage route handlers.

So, we don't have to update our POST handler to accommodate our UI's List feature, since `listId` is already being passed into `reminders.create()`.

Mirage's association helpers are flexible enough to model nearly any data scenario, making your job easier when it comes time to mock endpoints that deal with relationships.

## Takeaways

- Mirage lets you define and access relational data
- Use the `belongsTo` and `hasMany` helpers to define named relationships on your models
- Use relationships in route handlers to return a model or collection that's associated with other models
- Mirage uses simple foreign keys to keep track of relational data
