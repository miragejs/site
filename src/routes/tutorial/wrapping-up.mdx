# Wrapping up

Congratulations on finishing the Mirage tutorial!

If you want to keep learning, you should now have enough context to understand all the content in the [Main concepts](/docs/main-concepts/route-handlers) section of the docs.

If you get stuck or have any questions, join us in the [Mirage JS Discord](https://discord.gg/pPsdsrn) or ask a question on [Stack Overflow with the "miragejs" tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/miragejs).

Happy mocking!
