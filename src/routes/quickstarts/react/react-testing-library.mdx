# Mock Network Requests in React Testing Library with Mirage

Use your Mirage server to test your React application under different server scenarios using [React Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library).

This guide is for people already using React Testing Library in their React apps.

## Use Mirage in a single test

Mirage can be used to mock out individual endpoints directly inside your test files.

### Step 1: Install Mirage

First, make sure you've added Mirage to your project:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install --save-dev miragejs

# Using Yarn
yarn add --dev miragejs
```

### Step 2: Create a Server within a test

Within a test file, import `Server` from Mirage, create a server, and mock out the API endpoints that your code needs:

```js{5-15,18-21}
// src/__tests__/App.test.js
import React from "react"
import { render, waitForElement } from "@testing-library/react"
import App from "../App"
import { Server } from "miragejs"

let server

beforeEach(() => {
  server = new Server()
})

afterEach(() => {
  server.shutdown()
})

it("shows the users from our server", async () => {
  server.get("/users", () => [
    { id: 1, name: "Luke" },
    { id: 2, name: "Leia" },
  ])

  const { getByTestId } = render(<App />)
  await waitForElement(() => getByTestId("user-1"))
  await waitForElement(() => getByTestId("user-2"))

  expect(getByTestId("user-1")).toHaveTextContent("Luke")
  expect(getByTestId("user-2")).toHaveTextContent("Leia")
})
```

When the `<App />` component is rendered and React makes a network request to `/users`, Mirage will intercept and respond with the data above.

Note that we've called `server.shutdown()` after each test, so that Mirage has a chance to clean itself up and not leak into other tests.

## Use a shared Mirage server across all tests

If you're ready to [centralize your Mirage server in order to share it between development and testing](/docs/workflow-tips/#sharing-your-server-between-development-and-testing), follow these steps to use your shared server in your tests.

### Step 1: Install Mirage

First, make sure you've added Mirage to your project:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install --save-dev miragejs

# Using Yarn
yarn add --dev miragejs
```

### Step 2: Define your server

A common place to define your shared server is `src/server.js`:

```js
// src/server.js
import { Server, Model } from "miragejs"

export function makeServer({ environment = "test" } = {}) {
  let server = new Server({
    environment,

    models: {
      user: Model,
    },

    seeds(server) {
      server.create("user", { name: "Bob" })
      server.create("user", { name: "Alice" })
    },

    routes() {
      this.namespace = "api"

      this.get("/users", schema => {
        return schema.users.all()
      })
    },
  })

  return server
}
```

> In an app build with Create React App, make sure this file is under the `src/` directory so that changes to it trigger rebuilds.

### Step 3: Use your shared server in your tests

Import your `makeServer` function and start and shutdown your server using the `beforeEach` and `afterEach` functions. Then, use your tests to seed Mirage with data, or make other changes to put Mirage into the state you need:

```js{5-15,18-19}
// src/__tests__/App.test.js
import React from "react"
import { render, waitForElement } from "@testing-library/react"
import App from "../App"
import { makeServer } from "../server"

let server

beforeEach(() => {
  server = makeServer()
})

afterEach(() => {
  server.shutdown()
})

it("shows the users from our server", async () => {
  server.create("user", { name: "Luke" })
  server.create("user", { name: "Leia" })

  const { getByTestId } = render(<App />)
  await waitForElement(() => getByTestId("user-1"))
  await waitForElement(() => getByTestId("user-2"))

  expect(getByTestId("user-1")).toHaveTextContent("Luke")
  expect(getByTestId("user-2")).toHaveTextContent("Leia")
})
```

Each test will get its own isolated Mirage server instance, and no state or server modifications you make will leak across tests.

Make sure your server gets instantiated with the `test` environment. (In the example `makeServer` function above, we default `environment` to `test`.)
