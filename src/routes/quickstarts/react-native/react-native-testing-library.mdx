# Mock API Requests in React Native Testing Library with Mirage

Use your Mirage server to test your React Native app under different server scenarios using [@testing-library/react-native](https://github.com/testing-library/native-testing-library), [Jest Native](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-native), and [Jest Expo](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/guides/testing-with-jest/).

_This guide assumes your app is already set up with React Native Testing Library, Jest Native, and Expo. It should also work with both [react-test-renderer](https://reactjs.org/docs/test-renderer.html) and [react-native-testing-library](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-testing-library)._

## Step 1: Install Mirage

First, make sure you have Mirage installed:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install --save-dev miragejs

# Using Yarn
yarn add --dev miragejs
```

## Step 2: Setup your testing environment

We'll need to update our Jest environment to work with Mirage.

First, install the polyfill for XMLHttpRequest:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install --save-dev xmlhttprequest

# Using Yarn
yarn add --dev xmlhttprequest
```

Then create a new `jest.setup.js` file in the root of your project. We'll use this file to patch the `global` variable and add support for XMLHttpRequest, self, and window.

```js
// jest.setup.js
global.self = global
global.window = {}
global.XMLHttpRequest = require("xmlhttprequest").XMLHttpRequest
```

Finally, have Jest to load the environment that we just created using `jest.config.js`.

```js
// jest.config.js
const jestPreset = require("@testing-library/react-native/jest-preset")

module.exports = {
  preset: "jest-expo",
  setupFiles: [...jestPreset.setupFiles],
  setupFilesAfterEnv: ["./jest.setup.js"],
}
```

Here we're telling Jest to execute our `jest.setup.js` after it sets up the test environment.

## Step 3: Create a Mirage Server within a test

Within a test file, import `Server` from Mirage, create a server, and mock out the API endpoints your code depends on:

```js{5-15,18-21}
// App.test.js
import React from "react"
import { render, waitForElement } from "@testing-library/react-native"
import App from "../App"
import { Server } from "miragejs"

let server

beforeEach(() => {
  server = new Server()
})

afterEach(() => {
  server.shutdown()
})

it("shows the users from our server", async () => {
  server.get("/users", () => [
    { id: 1, name: "Luke" },
    { id: 2, name: "Leia" },
  ])

  const { getByTestId } = render(<App />)
  await waitForElement(() => getByTestId("user-1"))
  await waitForElement(() => getByTestId("user-2"))

  expect(getByTestId("user-1")).toHaveTextContent("Luke")
  expect(getByTestId("user-2")).toHaveTextContent("Leia")
})
```

When the `<App />` component renders and makes a network request to `/users`, Mirage will intercept and respond with the data above.

Note that we've called `server.shutdown()` after each test, so that Mirage has a chance to clean itself up and not leak into other tests.
