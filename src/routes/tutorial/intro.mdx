# Intro

This tutorial will teach you the fundamentals of mocking out any HTTP API with Mirage.
While Mirage can be used to mock out GraphQL APIs, we'll be working with a REST API.

In this tutorial you'll learn Mirage by **building a Reminders app** written in React. You don't have to be proficient in React to follow the tutorial – we'll be providing all the code you'll need along the way.

Here's an example of the final result:

## Setup

First let’s get your development environment ready. You'll need [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, and you'll be using your own text editor and terminal app.

Next, copy down the tutorial project and install its dependencies:

```shell
npx degit github:miragejs/tutorial && cd tutorial && yarn
```

Then start your app:

```shell
yarn start
```

This should run a development server on **port 3000**.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser and you should see a page that looks like this:

If you do, you're ready to start mocking!
