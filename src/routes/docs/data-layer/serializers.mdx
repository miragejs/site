# Serializers

A _serializer_ is an object responsible for transforming a Model or Collection that's returned from your route handlers:

```js
this.get("movies/:id", (schema, request) => {
  return schema.movies.find(request.params.id)
})
```

into a JSON payload that's formatted the way your frontend app expects:

```json
// GET /movies/1

{
  "data": {
    "id": "1",
    "type": "movies",
    "attributes": {
      "title": "Interstellar"
    }
  }
}
```

Serializers are the last main part of Mirage's architecture that interacts with the Data Layer, because producing a well-formatted JSON response often involves traversing the relationship graph of your models.

Let's see how they work.

## Choosing which serializer to use

The first step in working with Mirage's serializers is to choose which included serializer to start with, which in turn depends on what JSON format your backend uses to serve data to your JavaScript app.

The JSON payload above is an example of an API that follows [the JSON:API spec](https://jsonapi.org/). It has a very specific structure that differentiates attributes from relationships, supports named and polymorphic relationships, links, query param includes and more. It also solves a lot of problems that exist in other formats that are less rigorously defined.

If your existing backend API does use JSON:API, Mirage ships with a `JSONAPISerializer` that will do the heavy lifting for you. And if you're starting a new app, consider using JSON:API, since it answers so many questions you'll run into and can help your team avoid bike shedding.

Of course, there are plenty of JavaScript apps that don't use JSON:API as their API serialization format.

Mirage ships with two other named serializers that match other popular backend formats. `ActiveModelSerializer` is intended to mimic APIs that resemble Rails APIs built with the `active_model_serializer` gem, and `RestSerializer` is a good starting point for many other common API.

Depending on your own backend API's format, you'll need to choose the closest serializer as a starting point and customize it to match your production format. We'll talk about that later in this guide.

<!-- ## Defining serializers

Once you've selected the appropriate serializer, define your default application-wide serializer by exporting it from `/mirage/serializers/application.js`:

```js
// mirage/serializers/application.js
import { JSONAPISerializer } from "ember-cli-mirage"

export default JSONAPISerializer.extend({})
```

This specifies the serializer to use for each Model and Collection in your system.

If you need to customize a serializer for a particular model type, you can define model-specific serializers that take precedence over your application serializer.

Let's use Mirage's generator to create a `Movie` serializer:

```
ember g mirage-serializer movie
```

This creates the file

```js
import ApplicationSerializer from "./application"

export default ApplicationSerializer.extend({})
```

which follows the best practice of model-specific serializers extending from your Application serializer.

You can now customize the behavior of how `Movie` models and collections are serialized into JSON.

## Customizing serializers

When it comes to customizing your application's serializers, you'll mostly be tweaking Mirage's defaults.

For example, if your Ember app expects attribute names to be PascalCase

```js
// GET /movies/1

{
  Id: '1',
  ReleaseDate: 'Interstellar'
}
```

you might override the Serializer's `keyForAttribute` method:

```js
import { Serializer } from "ember-cli-mirage"
import { classify } from "@ember/string"

export default Serializer.extend({
  keyForAttribute(attr) {
    return classify(attr)
  },
})
```

See the API docs for each serializer to learn more about all the customization hooks available.

## Relationships

Relationships are another important aspect of Serializers, as backends have many different ways of dealing with relationships.

For example, the `JSONAPISerializer` respects query param includes

```
GET /movies/1?include=cast-members
```

out of the box. But sometimes Ember apps expect a resource payload to have all their relationship IDs defined, regardless if the request used query param includes.

There's an option on `JSONAPISerializer` that enables this:

```js
import { JSONAPISerializer } from "ember-cli-mirage"

export default JSONAPISerializer.extend({
  alwaysIncludeLinkageData: true,
})
```

Now, a GET request to `/movies/1` would respond with this payload:

```js
{
  data: {
    id: '1',
    type: 'movies';,
    attributes: {
      title: 'Interstellar'
    },
    relationships: {
      'cast-members': {
        data: [
          { type: 'people', id: '1' },
          { type: 'people', id: '2' },
          { type: 'people', id: '3' },
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The Ember app could now use these ids to subsequently fetch the related cast members.

Other times, an Ember app expects to get a link to fetch related data. The `JSONAPISerializer` also has a hook for this:

```js
// mirage/serializers/movie.js
import ApplicationSerializer from "./application"

export default ApplicationSerializer.extend({
  links(movie) {
    return {
      "cast-members": {
        related: `/api/movies/${movie.id}/cast-members`,
      },
    }
  },
})
```

Now a GET request to `/movies/1` would respond with this payload:

```js
{
  data: {
    id: '1',
    type: 'movies';,
    attributes: {
      title: 'Interstellar'
    },
    relationships: {
      'cast-members': {
        links: {
          related: `/api/movies/1/cast-members`
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The other serializers also have mechanisms controlling how related data can be loaded. Be sure to check out the API docs for all the details.

## Working with serialized JSON

While most route handlers should return a Model or Collection instance, and leave the serialization logic up to the Serializer, sometimes it can be convenient to perform some final serialization logic directly in your route handler.

You can use the `this.serialize` helper method to do this - make sure to use a `function` instead of a fat arrow so you have access to the correct `this`:

```js
// mirage/config.js
this.get("/movies", function(schema, request) {
  let movies = schema.movies.all()
  let json = this.serialize(movies)

  json.meta.size = movies.length

  return json
})
```

The `serialize` helper will use the typical lookup logic to first check for a model-specific serializer, and then fall back to the default Application serializer.

You can also use a specific serializer if you have a special case by passing in the name of the serialize as a second argument:

```js
// mirage/config.js
this.get("/movies", function(schema, request) {
  let movies = schema.movies.all()
  let json = this.serialize(movies, "movie-with-relationship")

  json.meta.size = movies.length

  return json
})
```

This route handler would use the `mirage/serializers/movie-with-relationship.js` serializer to transform the collection of movies into a `json` payload, which is then modified and then finally returned from the route handler.

---

In general, you should not need to write much code dealing with Mirage serializers. Even if your backend doesn't adhere to one of the predefined formats, you should be able to use the provided hooks to implement an ApplicationSerializer that works for the majority of your models.

The more conventional your backend API is, the less code you'll need to write â€“ not only in Mirage, but also in other parts of your Ember application!

Now that we've covered the ins and outs of Mirage's data layer, we're ready to see how we can use Mirage to effectively test our Ember application. -->
