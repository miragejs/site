# Mock a component's network requests with React Testing Library and Mirage

Use Mirage to mock out individual API endpoints directly inside your tests written with [React Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library).

This guide is for people already using React Testing Library in their React apps.

## Step 1: Install Mirage

First, make sure you've added Mirage to your project:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install --save-dev miragejs

# Using Yarn
yarn add --dev miragejs
```

## Step 2: Create a Server within a test

Within a test file, import `Server` from Mirage, create a server, and mock out the API endpoints that your code needs:

```js{5-15,18-21}
// src/__tests__/App.test.js
import React from "react"
import { render, waitForElement } from "@testing-library/react"
import App from "../App"
import { createServer } from "miragejs"

let server

beforeEach(() => {
  server = createServer()
//  If your API is at a different port or host than your app, you'll need something like:
//  server = createServer({
//    environment: "test",
//    urlPrefix: "http://api.acme.com:3000",
//  })
})

afterEach(() => {
  server.shutdown()
})

it("shows the users from our server", async () => {
  server.get("/users", () => [
    { id: 1, name: "Luke" },
    { id: 2, name: "Leia" },
  ])

  const { getByTestId } = render(<App />)
  await waitForElement(() => getByTestId("user-1"))
  await waitForElement(() => getByTestId("user-2"))

  expect(getByTestId("user-1")).toHaveTextContent("Luke")
  expect(getByTestId("user-2")).toHaveTextContent("Leia")
})
```

When the `<App />` component is rendered and React makes a network request to `/users`, Mirage will intercept and respond with the data above.

Note that we've called `server.shutdown()` after each test, so that Mirage has a chance to clean itself up and not leak into other tests.
