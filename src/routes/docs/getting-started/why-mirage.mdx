Mirage was originally built to bring some conventions to an HTTP mocking setup that was used across multiple projects. It ended up proving most useful by enabling frontend developers to work on their apps without having to rely on any local or staging backend services as part of their normal development workflow.

Since then, Mirage has focused on making it as easy as possible for developers to maintain a mock server alongside their frontend codebase.
