# Develop a React App against a Shared Mirage Server

Once you're ready to [centralize your Mirage server and share it between development and testing](/docs/workflow-tips/#sharing-your-server-between-development-and-testing), follow these steps.

## Step 1: Install Mirage

First, make sure you've added Mirage to your project:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install --save-dev miragejs

# Using Yarn
yarn add --dev miragejs
```

## Step 2: Define your shared server

A common place to define your shared server is `src/server.js`:

```js
// src/server.js
import { Server, Model } from "miragejs"

export function makeServer({ environment = "test" } = {}) {
  let server = new Server({
    environment,

    models: {
      user: Model,
    },

    seeds(server) {
      server.create("user", { name: "Bob" })
      server.create("user", { name: "Alice" })
    },

    routes() {
      this.namespace = "api"

      this.get("/users", (schema) => {
        return schema.users.all()
      })
    },
  })

  return server
}
```

> In an app build with Create React App, make sure this file is under the `src/` directory so that changes to it trigger rebuilds.

## Step 3: Start your server in development

Open your React app's bootstrap file (`src/index.js` in a Create React App), import your `makeServer` function, and call it in the development environment:

```js{5-9}
// src/index.js
import React from "react"
import ReactDOM from "react-dom"
import App from "./App"
import { makeServer } from "./server"

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "development") {
  makeServer()
}

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"))
```

We're using the `process.env.NODE_ENV` environment variable here, which is a common global variable available in many React app environments.

Now, whenever any component in your application makes a network request in development, Mirage will intercept that request and respond with the data from your server definition.

You now have a central place to define and update your Mirage server as you continue local development on your React app.
