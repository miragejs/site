# Introduction

<Lead>
  Mirage is a JavaScript library that lets frontend developers mock out backend
  APIs.

  scenarios that are typically only possible with real production servers.

Mirage was originally built to bring some conventions to an HTTP mocking setup that was used across multiple projects. It ended up proving most useful by enabling frontend developers to work on their apps without having to rely on any local or staging backend services as part of their normal development workflow.

Since then, Mirage has focused on making it as easy as possible for developers to maintain a mock server alongside their frontend codebase.

## How it works

Mirage runs in the browser. It intercepts any `XMLHttpRequest` or `fetch` requests your JavaScript app makes and lets you mock the response. That means you can develop and test your app just as if it were talking to a real server.

For example, if we were working on this React component

```js
// App.js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react"

export function App() {
  let [users, setUsers] = useState([])

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch("/api/users")
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(json => setUsers(json))
  }, [])

  return (
    <ul>
      {users.map(user => (
        <li key={user.id}>{user.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

we could set up a basic Mirage server to handle the `/api/users` network request it makes:

```js
// index.js
import React from "react"
import ReactDOM from "react-dom"
import App from "./app"
import { Server } from "@miragejs/server"

new Server({
  routes(server) {
    server.get("/users", () => [
      { id: "1", name: "Luke" },
      { id: "2", name: "Leah" },
      { id: "3", name: "Anakin" },
    ])
  },
})

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"))
```

Importantly, because Mirage mocks at the HTTP boundary, you never need to modify your application code to account for whether your app is talking to Mirage or to your real production backend.

In addition to intercepting HTTP requests, Mirage provides a mock database and helper functions that make it easy to simulate dynamic backend services.

Mirage borrows concepts from typical server-side frameworks like

- **routes** to handle HTTP requests
- a **database** and **models** for storing data and defining relationships
- **factories** and **fixtures** for stubbing data, and
- **serializers** for formatting HTTP responses

to make it easy to simulate production server behavior.
