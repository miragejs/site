# Overview

These quickstart guides will help you get Mirage working with your particular combination of JavaScript framework and test runner.

If you are new to Mirage and want to learn how it works, give <Link to='/docs/getting-started/introduction/'>the guides</Link> a read first.

If you don't see your tool listed here, there's a good chance Mirage will still work with your tech. A quickstart guide probably just hasn't been written yet. [Check this site's PRs](https://github.com/miragejs/site/pulls) to see if there's already one being worked on, and if not, feel free to open a PR to get yours added!
