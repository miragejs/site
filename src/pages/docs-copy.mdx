# Mirage.js

Mirage is a JavaScript library that lets frontend developers mock out backend APIs.

Unlike other mocking libraries, Mirage makes it easy to reproduce dynamic scenarios that are typically only possible when using a true production server.

Equipped with a Mirage server, a frontend developer can build, test, and even share a complete working JavaScript application without having to use or configure any backend services.

## Installation

To install Mirage.js, run

```sh
yarn add @miragejs/server
```

## Usage

Mirage lets you simulate API responses by writing **route handlers**.

The simplest example of a route handler is a function that returns an object:

```js
import { Server } from "@miragejs/server"

let server = new Server()

server.get("/movies", () => {
  return [
    { id: 1, type: "movies", name: "Interstellar" },
    { id: 2, type: "movies", name: "Inception" },
    { id: 3, type: "movies", name: "Dunkirk" },
  ]
})
```

Now whenever your JavaScript app makes a GET request to `/api/movies`, Mirage will respond with this data.
