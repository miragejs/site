# Intro

This tutorial will teach you the fundamentals of mocking out any HTTP API with Mirage.
While Mirage can be used to mock out GraphQL APIs, this tutorial will cover a basic REST API.

You'll learn Mirage by **mocking out the API for a Reminders app**. The app is written in React, but you don't need to know React to follow along since you'll only be writing Mirage code.

Here's an example of the final result:

## Setup

First letâ€™s get your development environment ready. You'll need [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, and you'll be using your own text editor and terminal app.

Next, download the tutorial and install its dependencies:

```shell
npx degit github:miragejs/tutorial mirage-tutorial &&
  cd mirage-tutorial &&
  yarn
```

Then open the project in your editor and start your app:

```shell
yarn start
```

This should run a development server on **port 3000**.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser and you should see a page that looks like this:

If you do, you're ready to start mocking!
