# Intro

This tutorial will teach you the fundamentals of mocking out any HTTP API with Mirage.
While Mirage can be used to mock out GraphQL APIs, this tutorial will cover a basic REST API.

You'll learn Mirage by **mocking out the API for a Reminders app**. The app is written in React, but you don't need to know React to follow along since you'll only be writing Mirage code.

There is no real API server running, so the app doesn't work to start. As you implement each API endpoint, you'll be restoring the functionality of the app.

Here's an example of the final result:

## Setup

First letâ€™s get your development environment ready. You'll need [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, and you'll be using your own text editor and terminal app.

Next, download the tutorial and install its dependencies:

```shell
npx degit github:miragejs/tutorial mirage-tutorial
cd mirage-tutorial
yarn install

# You can also use npm:
npm install
```

Then open the project in your editor and start your app:

```shell
yarn start

# or npm run start
```

This should run a development server on **port 3000**.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser and you should see a page that looks like this:

If you do, you're ready to start mocking!
